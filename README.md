### Modeling Structure
Waterfall model was taken under consideration and process while making this small project. Waterfall model consist of <br>
1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis <br>
2. Designing <br>
3. Coding <br>
4. Testing <br>
5. Deployment

### Process
- As there were no particular essentials to be followed Requirement Gathering & Analysis was just taken on a hypothetical note.
- Now working towards the details imagened, the design of the program was structured.
- After it the design was converted into Code using C++ language's basic implementation
- There was no harsh testing done as the program is a basic implementation, just that all the functions worked fine and there was no syntax, semantic or runtime error was enough
- Deployment and Testing was done in Windows, by running the C++ Program in command prompt
- 2 files named temp.dat and itemstore.dat are created when data of item is input.
